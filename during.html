    <p>I observed the landscape of the beautiful city of Baltimore I had before me. It was barren and just a typical 
Northeastern city to me, so it seemed. After much pondering and thinking, I decided just what Baltimore needed: a penguin exhibit. 
And not just any penguin exhibit, an exhibit not fenced in and larger than life! What Baltimore citizen doesn't want to view penguins in their
not-so-natural habitat on their walk to the market or to work? I found a picture of penguins that was cohesive with the angle of the photo.
I also made sure the picture would blend nicely with the landscape I was provided. I then opened Photoshop and began my work.
While working on this project I was watching videos of penguins on <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>.</p>
